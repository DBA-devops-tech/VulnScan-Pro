const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
```

**Frontend API service (create in frontend/src/services/api.js):**
```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:5000/api';

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: API_BASE_URL,
});

// Add token to requests
api.interceptors.request.use(
  (config) => {
    const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
    if (token) {
      config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
    }
    return config;
  },
  (error) => Promise.reject(error)
);

export default api;
```

## ü§î Interview Questions & Answers

### Technical Questions:

**Q: How does your port scanner work?**
A: "I implemented a multi-threaded port scanner using Python's socket library. It uses TCP connect() calls to test port availability, with configurable timeouts and thread pools for performance. The scanner can handle 1000+ ports efficiently and includes service identification for common ports like HTTP (80), SSH (22), etc."

**Q: How did you implement JWT authentication?**
A: "I used Flask-JWT-Extended for token management. User passwords are hashed with bcrypt before storage. Upon login, the server generates a JWT token with user ID and expiration. The React frontend stores this token and includes it in the Authorization header for protected API calls."

**Q: What security vulnerabilities does your scanner detect?**
A: "The web scanner checks for missing security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options), information disclosure through error messages and HTML comments, insecure HTTP methods, SSL/TLS configuration issues, and server version disclosure. The port scanner identifies potentially vulnerable services like Telnet, FTP, and RDP."

**Q: How do you prevent false positives in scanning?**
A: "I implement multiple validation layers: confirming open ports with proper socket connections, analyzing HTTP response codes and content patterns, and using severity classification. The scanner also provides detailed context for each finding so users can validate results."

**Q: How would you scale this application?**
A: "For scaling, I'd implement: Redis for scan queue management, separate worker processes for scanning tasks, database optimization with PostgreSQL, API rate limiting, and horizontal scaling with load balancers. I'd also add scan result caching and implement WebSocket connections for real-time updates."

### Project Questions:

**Q: What was the biggest challenge in this project?**
A: "The biggest challenge was implementing concurrent scanning without overwhelming target systems. I solved this by implementing thread pools with configurable limits, proper timeout handling, and graceful error recovery. This ensures the scanner is both efficient and responsible."

**Q: How did you ensure the application's security?**
A: "I implemented multiple security layers: input validation and sanitization, SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries, CORS configuration, JWT token expiration, password hashing with salt, and rate limiting. I also added ethical usage warnings and guidelines."

**Q: What would you add to improve this project?**
A: "I'd add: advanced vulnerability assessment (XSS, SQL injection testing), integration with CVE databases, automated scheduling of scans, more comprehensive reporting with charts, user role management, and API integration with tools like Nmap and OpenVAS."
